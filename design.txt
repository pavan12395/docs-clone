Solutions :- 

MySQL tables :- 
    Users (varchar(20) name,varchar(20) password) --> index on field `name`
    #How do we store documents in the DB and documents will be fetched rapidly , Blobs vs FileSystem
    Docs (varchar(20) name,varchar(20) userName , Longblob docData); --> index on field `name`


Redis Cache :- 
    Stores the details of all the documents and a Worker will actively sync it with DB for every 1 min
    all api's interacting with the database first query Redis
        if not present , fetch them from db and store them in cache
        if present , fetch it
